# Instructions to download and run the React frontend

1. Install Node.js on your computer. This is a link to the official site. https://nodejs.org/en

2. in a terminal/powershell/bash/whatever with admin priveledges, run
  
     npm install react-router-dom

   This will install the react-router library

3. in the same terminal with admin priveledges, navigate to the directory with the react project. In this case, that will likely be

   C:\Users\ *Your_Name* \Downloads\ *Path to \Crawl_AI_MVP on your local machine* \crawl_AI_react_full_code

4. run the command

     npm start

  This will start the React server, and open a tab on your computer at localhost:3000 for the site

To exit the React app, return to the terminal and press ctrl + c. The terminal will ask if you wish to terminate the application (Y/N). Type in Y, then press enter. Finally, close the terminal.
